## Features

### Cross-Platform

(Should) work on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Automated Mod Loading

You can search for mods from Modrinth in the integrated mod manager, and click them to install. From here, whenever you launch a version, Cesena automatically finds all compatible mods with your selected version and mod loader, and copies them to your mods folder. This allows you to go from 1.20.4 Fabric to 1.21.10 Forge and all your mods that support both versions will automatically work.

### Built with Qt

No Electron! Save your system resources!
